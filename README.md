# Matlab-Exam-Project

This was the final project of a course I took during my master programme.
The level is not very high.

The feedback from the teaching assistant is also in this repository.

It was a teamwork; I worked on the plot function, the only part which was perfect.

Unfortunately, it's beena long time and I don't have the data that we tested the project on to show the results.
